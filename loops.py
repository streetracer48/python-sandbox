# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple,a dictionary, a set, or a string  )

people = ['john', 'will', 'janet', 'karen']

#Simple loop

# for person in people:
#     print('cureent person is',person)


#Break out

# for person in people :
#     if(person == 'janet'):
#         break
#     print('Current person is', person)
    # else:
    #       print('Current person is', person)  

#Continue

# for person in people :
#     if(person == 'janet'):
#        continue
#     print('Current person is', person)
#     # else:
    #       print('Current person is', person)  


# #Range
# for i in range(len(people)):
#     print('Current Person:', people[i], i)

# for i in range(0,11):
#     print('the number is',i)


#while loops excute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

# count =0
# while count <=10:
#     print('Count:', count)
#     count +=1
